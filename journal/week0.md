# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

**REQUIRED HOMEWORK/TASKS**

I was able to create MFA  for my root user and my iam user. 
Then i generated Access keys for the iam user which i earlier used in installing AWS CLI locally on my github code space.

##IAM USER##

I created the IAM User, created a group then i assigned the group policies and permissions for the user. 
A user can be given additional policies and permissions as and when needed and it is always recommened to assign
policies and permissions to a user as and when needed.

**Conceptual and Logical  Diagram using lucid charts **

I had the chance to create an account on Lucid charts to design and create architectural Diagrams. 
i used the aws shapes with guide videos to redesign the diagram to my own preference and required logos

##AWS CLI##

After installing the aws CLI in my codespace
I also used the Access Keys Generated to Access my AWS account via the CLI which gives me the Access to 
create instances and initiate some services via the CLI without using the UI. 

I generated a Budget from the CLI with the guidance of Examples of the CLI commands from the AWS CLI guide

i also went on to generate Notifications and alarms from the aws CLI using commands

**AWS architectured tool**

i also had the chance to review the AWS architectured tool and created it with a guide. 

_Im still reviewing them tho cause its alot and im attending the bootcamp whiles working and schooling at the same time._

But im sure once im done revewing all of it i will update my Journal.

I also opened a Service ticket with aws and i tried using the chat tool. Traditionally you would recommend an email 
response but since im trying them out i want to see if they always had a readily available support person in the chat but that didnt work.
im still waiting for supports response.

**Great news is, i finally got a response from support and they shared a few kbs. I'm glad they acknowledged my ticket**
