# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Week 1 Started Tough with me cause i've been swarmed with school and 
it also started with a lot of bugs. 

I recreated the Repositories so many times to figure where i went wrong. 
But all along the reason was just right before me.

Gitpod is the recommended Code Space used for the Project however i was using githubs default codespace.
Changed my CodeSPace to GitPod and it resolved my Bug!
