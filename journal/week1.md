# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Week 1 Started Tough with me cause i've been swarmed with school and 
it also started with a lot of bugs. 

I recreated the Repositories so many times to figure where i went wrong. 
But all along the reason was just right before me.

Gitpod is the recommended Code Space used for the Project however i was using githubs default codespace.
Changed my CodeSPace to GitPod and it resolved my Bug!

So the Crudder Home frontend and Backend code is running successfully 
from the container images.

Successfully all ports are open and working fine as well
