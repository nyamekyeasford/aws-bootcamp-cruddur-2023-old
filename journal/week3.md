# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

1. Create a User Pool - Making a web App and you want to add login and sign up where you want manage them externally. 
				You can add different Identity providers
				(identity pools, and user pools. 
2. I Used a Custom Password requirements to see what its like. 
3. Installed AWS Amplify into our code and imported it in our front end script file
4. Imported the Cognito API and React ID into our docker compose code
5. Now we get an incorrect password once we made entries of wrong credentials 
6. I then imported a user locally into our repo and able to log in successfully. 

This weeks Homeworks may be a bit challenging and i would require more knowledge on JWTs and Middleware. I may have to come back to 
this later in the project and learn how to implement these. As i have very limited time to tackle these cause of school work too. 
But im very much learning and understanding some AWS services and new things i can implement and run!
